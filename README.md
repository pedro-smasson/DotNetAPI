# DotNetAPI

This project was created based on [Balta's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/balta-io/) course [Fundamentos do ASP.NET 6](https://balta.io/player/assistir/8407be55-4137-48ae-baf5-470eef47a297). It helped me develop my C# skills, as well as learn more about APIs, Entity Framework, and some good development practices.
